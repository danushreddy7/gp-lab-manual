## EXP: 07-AI CHASING.
## Date:29/4/25
## Aim:
To implement-chasing when AI see the player.
## Algorithm:
STEP-1: Set up the AI character Blueprint and add a Sphere Collision component to the AI
character Blueprint and position and scale the Sphere Collision component to represent the AI's
detection range.
STEP-2: Create a new AI controller Blueprint and select Create Basic Asset > Blueprint
Class from that choose the AIController as the parent class.
STEP-3: Open the AIController Blueprint and drag off the execution line and search for "Set
Sight Radius" where the Sight Radius value to the desired range for the AI's vision.
STEP-4: Implement perception for the AI and connect the output of the AI Perception
Component node to the AI Controller's .AI Perception property in the AI Perception
Component node, configure the settings for sight and sight sense
STEP-5: Implement the chase behaviour if the stimulus is the player character, drag off the
execution line and search for "Move To Actor" and set the Move To Actor node's target to
the player character.
STEP-6: Create blackboard keys for the AI and create a new blackboard object and assign it
to the AIController's Blackboard property. Drag off the execution line again and search for
"Create Blackboard Key".
STEP-7: Update blackboard values. Set the Blackboard Key to the "PlayerLocation" key
you created earlier.
STEP-8: Set up the Behavior Tree by Open the Behavior Tree asset in the Behavior Tree
editor.

## Result:
Thus, the AI concept to the actor for a random movement.
